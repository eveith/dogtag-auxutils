.SH DESCRIPTION

.B renew-certificates
is a simple certificate autorenewer. Given a list of certificates and keys it
checks which certificates are about to expire, and automatically renews them
using the autorenew profile of a Dogtag PKI instance.

The list of certificate and private key file locations is given via the
\fI-i\fP parameter. This input file contains one entry per line, consisting of
two columns: The first column indicates the path to the certificate, the
second column the path to the private key corresponding to the certificate.
Both files must be readable and PEM-encoded. The columns are separated by a
space character (\\s+). A backslash (\\) escapes the following space.  Columns
starting with a hash sign (#) are treated as comments.

.B renew-certificates
then contacts the REST API endpoint of the Dogtag PKI instance, given via the
\fI-u\fP parameter, via POST. The API endpoint used is
\fI/ca/eeca/ca/profileSubmitSSLClient\fR. With the private key, the
certificate is then renewed and stored in the place of the original
certificate.

.B renew-certificates is service-agnostic, i.e., it does not restart any
service automatically.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.BR \-u \fIURI\fR
The base URI of the Dogtag PKI server instance. The default is
\fIhttps://localhost:8443\fR. \fBrenew-certificates\fR will issue a
POST request to \fIURI/ca/eeca/ca/profileSubmitSSLClient\fR to
renew a certificate. It authenticates itself using the certificate and private
key in question. Hence, \fBrenew-certificates\fR cannot be used to renew
already expired certificates.

.TP
.BR \-i \fIFILE\fR
Designates the file that contains the list of certificates and key files.
This input file contains one entry per line, consisting of
two columns: The first column indicates the path to the certificate, the
second column the path to the private key corresponding to the certificate.
Both files must be readable and PEM-encoded. The columns are separated by a
space character (\\s+). A backslash (\\) escapes the following space.  Columns
starting with a hash sign (#) are treated as comments.
The default is to read from STDIN; the special file name \fI-\fR also causes
\fBrenew-certificates\fR to read the list of certificate and key files from
STDIN.

.TP
.BR \-d \fIDAYS\fR
The number of days to warn in advance. Default is \fI60\fR days.

.TP
.BR \-h
Prints a short help message.

.SH EXAMPLE

The following command invocation renews the certificate at \fI/my/cert.pem\fR,
authenticating itself using \fI/my/key.pem\fR, if it is about to expire. The
Dogtag PKI instance is contacted via POST under
\fIhttps://pki.example.com/ca/eeca/ca/profileSubmitSSLClient\fR. This list of
certificates/key files is read from STDIN.
