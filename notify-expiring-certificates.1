.SH DESCRIPTION

.B notify-expiring-certificates
notifies holders of X.509 certificates when their certificate is about to
expire. This Perl script queries a Dogtag PKI instance via its REST interface
for a list of certificates; for each valid certificate it checks whether the
it will expire in a given number of days, and if so, it generates an e-mail to
the certificate holder.

.B notify-expiring-certificates
issues a GET request to the PKI server's REST endpoint at
\fI/ca/rest/certs?start=$start&size=50&maxResults=-1\fR and reads the XML
returned. For all certificates that are valid, it checks its expiration date:
If the certificate will expire in a number of days less than or equal to the
Iwarning time, given by \fB-d\fR, the user will be notified by e-mail.
The user's e-mail address is taken from the \fIE=\fR tag of the certificate's
subject DN. If this tag does not exist, the fallback e-mail address given by
the \fB-t\fR parameter will be used.

.B notify-expiring-certificates
does not authenticate against the PKI server.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.BR \-u \fIURI\fR
The base URI of the Dogtag PKI server instance. The default is
\fIhttps://localhost:8443\fR. \fBnotify-expiring-certificates\fR will issue a
GET request to \fIURI/ca/rest/certs?start=$start&size=50&maxResults=-1\fR to
retrieve the complete list of certificates. It does not authenticate, but
takes care of paging.

.TP
.BR \-m \fISERVER\fR
The SMTP mail server used for sending the warning e-mails. The server must
accept unencrypted connections on port 25/tcp (SMTP). This flag is required.

.TP
.BR \-f \fIFROM\fR
The e-mail address the warning mails appear to come from. This flag must be
given, there is no default.

.TP
.BR \-t \fITO\fR
A catch-all e-mail address where warnings about certificates without e-mail
tag in their subject DN are sent to. This flag must be given, there is no 
default.

.TP
.BR \-d \fIDAYS\fR
The number of days to warn in advance. Default is \fI60\fR days. The script
will warn on every invocation; it does not save who got already notified. The
warning mails will only end when the certificate has been renewed.

.TP
.BR \-h
Prints a short help message.

.SH EXAMPLE

The following command invocation queries the Dogtag PKI instance at
\fIhttps://pki.example.com:443\fR and warns all holders whose certificates
will expire in 90 days or less. The warning e-mail will come from
\fIcertmaster@example.com\fR, which is also the catch-all mail address when
the certificate has no e-mail associated with it in its subject DN. The mail
server used in this case is \fImx.example.com\fR.
